                <h2 class="header">Synopsis</h2>
                <p>The story of Attack on Titan centers on a civilization inside three circular walls. According to the knowledge propagated locally, it is the last surviving vestige of human civilization. Its inhabitants, known as Eldians, have been led to believe that over one hundred years ago, humanity was driven to the brink of extinction after the emergence of humanoid giants called Titans, who attack and eat humans on sight. The last remnants of humanity retreated behind three concentric walls and enjoyed roughly a century of peace. Within the walls, the thought of venturing outside is strongly frowned upon and discouraged. To combat Titans, the country's military employs Vertical Maneuvering Equipment (VME), also called Omni-Directional Maneuvering Gear (ODM Gear): a set of waist-mounted grappling hooks and gas-powered propulsion enabling immense mobility in three dimensions. Swords made of ultrahard steel are used in conjunction with the gear, and eventually rocket launcher-like weapons called Thunder Spears are also developed.
                    There exist different types of Titans. Pure Titans are the weakest and most generic Titans, whose behavior is easy to predict, making them easy to kill. Abnormal Titans are Pure Titans whose behavior is more difficult to predict, making them far more dangerous. The Nine Titans, also known as Titan Shifters (Attack, Colossal, Armored, Female, Beast, Jaw, Cart, War Hammer, and Founding), are the strongest Titans; each is able to shift back and forth between human and Titan form to access their Titan's abilities. Many Titan Shifters also possess the ability to harden certain parts of their bodies at will, typically in order to make them virtually impenetrable, or to strengthen their blows during combat.
                    Pure Titans are created by injecting Eldians with Pure Titan spinal fluid. If a Pure Titan eats the human body of a person who possesses one of the Nine Titans, said Eldian will revert to human form and gain that Shifter's powers, whereupon they are cursed to live only 13 more years. If their powers are not inherited by another Eldian before their death, their powers will be inherited by an Eldian baby born shortly thereafter, regardless of distance or blood-relations.
                    As the story progresses, the true nature of the Titans and the existence of civilization outside the walls is revealed to the characters and the audience.

                <h2 class="header">Names and Attributes of Titans</h2>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><strong>Founding Titan</strong> - could turn Subjects of Ymir into Titans, control the minds of Titans, and alter the memories and bodies of Subjects of Ymir, but only if the inheritor had royal blood or was in contact with a Titan of royal blood. It was connected to all Subjects of Ymir and Titans via paths. Eren's form of the Founding Titan is called Doomsday Titan</li>
                    <li><strong>Armored Titan</strong> -  was covered by hardened, armor-like skin, except in key areas necessary for movement. It also possessed the ability to harden its arms and feet into sharper claws which could be used to climb structures such as the Walls.</li>
                    <li><strong>Attack Titan</strong> - could receive memories from both past and future inheritors of the Titan. Guided by these memories, it always moved ahead, fighting for freedom.</li>
                    <li><strong>Beast Titan</strong> - could take on the physical characteristics of different animals that vary between its inheritors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cart Titan</strong> - was quadrupedal and had great endurance that allowed it to stay transformed for long periods of time, as well as transform in rapid succession without needing to rest, hundreds of times per day even. Its speed rivaled that of the Jaw Titan.</li>
                    <li><strong>Colossus Titan</strong> - was enormous and could emit immense amounts of steam from its body like a blast furnace, at the gradual cost of its muscle tissue. The user was able to control the Titan's transformation power and blast radius.</li>
                    <li><strong>Female Titan</strong> - could inherit abilities much more easily than any of the other Titans. It could also harden areas of its skin for extra offensive and defensive capabilities. It also had the ability to summon Pure Titans with its scream.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jaw Titan</strong> - was the swiftest of the Nine Titans and had sharp, hardened teeth and claws capable of damaging or breaking almost anything.</li>
                    <li><strong>War Hammer Titan</strong> - could materialize various weapons and structures from its own hardened flesh. It could be controlled from afar through a cable of Titan flesh while the user remained hidden within a hardened crystal casing.</li>
                </ul>
